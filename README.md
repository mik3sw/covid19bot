## Scripts

HELP! My scrips work, but they are not so good and fast, if you want you can to contribute to make them better and faster! 

### Covid19 script

(2020) The daily report function is controlled by <code>plogins/covid19_script.py</code>. I created a Class that through requests gets data from Protezione Civile and with <code>plogins/covid19.py</code> compose the message (/day)
I also created a separated package here https://github.com/mik3sw/Covid-19-Italy, you can import it in your python code.

### Vaccines script

(2021) I also created a daily report about vaccines in Italy: this function is controlled by <code>plogins/vaccines_script.py</code>. I created a Class that through requests gets data from Protezione Civile and with <code>plogins/vaccines.py</code> compose the message (/vax)
